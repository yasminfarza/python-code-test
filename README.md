## Python Code Test

Here are functional solutions for some interesting problems like nested dictionary and python object print with their depth, and find LCA in a binary tree solutions.

### Question 1: Write the following functionâ€™s body. A nested dictionary is passed as parameter. Need to print all keys with their depth.
This problem-solution appears on `/core/dictionary_depth.py` and the unit test appears on `/tests/test_dict_depth.py` file.

### Question 2: Write a new function with same functionality from Question 1, but it should be able to handle a Python object in addition to a dictionary from Question 1.
This problem-solution appears on `/core/object_depth.py` and the unit test appears on `/tests/test_obj_depth.py` file.

### Question 3:  Write following functions body. 2 Nodes are passed as parameter. Need to find Least Common Ancestor and print its value.
This problem-solution appears on `/core/least_common_ancestor.py` and the unit test appears on `/tests/test_least_common_ancestor.py` file.

  And the runtime and memory requirements for this solution is:
  <ul>
    <li>The time complexity is O(n).</li>
    <li>The space complexity is constant.</li>
  </ul>

## TestCase
To test those solutions, run the command line in the terminal:

```
$ python -m unittest
```
